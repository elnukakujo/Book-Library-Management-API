## Description
A Book Library Management system is designed to efficiently manage the operations related to a library's collection of books. It provides functionalities to store, retrieve, update, and delete information about books and their availability.

To run the CRUD operations, you have two options:
- Use the REST Client VSCode extension to send request from the MyRequests.http file 
- Or go to localhost:{port}/swagger , for a better UI

## Access the database
If you want to access the database element without running the app, be sure to install the sqlite extension in vscode. Then open the command panel and open the database. A small windows opens in the bottom right letting you see the elements in your database
